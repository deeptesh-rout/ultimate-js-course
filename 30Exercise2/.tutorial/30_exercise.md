# Introduction
In this game (also known as rock, paper, scissors with a slight variation), the user will be playing against the computer. The game consists of three choices: snake, water, or gun. The computer will choose one of these at random, and the user must choose one as well. The game will then determine the winner based on the following rules:

* Snake drinks water and wins.
* Gun shoots the snake and wins.
* Water can drown the gun and wins.

Instead of `console.log()` to print the output, we will be using `document.write()` to print the output on the webpage. So lets disuss what is `document.write()` and how to use it.

# document.write()
In JavaScript, `document.write()` is a method that allows you to add content to an HTML document dynamically. The method writes a string of text to a document stream opened by the document.

Here's an example of how to use it:
```js
document.write("Hello, world!"); // This will print "Hello, world!" on the webpage
```

The solution for this exercise can be found in the Lesson 39. But try to solve it on your own first.
